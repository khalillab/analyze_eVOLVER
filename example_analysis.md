#Analysis of example data

For yeast_temp_expt, strains of yeast were grown in turbidostat mode at 5 different temperatures,
and halted after a set number of generations.

Unzip the file, and direct analyze_eVOLVER.m at the unzipped folder to generate plots and play around with settings. 
Note that since vial 15 did not contain cells, 'vials' should be set to [0:14].

Page through the graphs to see the effect of temperature on growth rate, and try different settings, such as switching between avg
and fit for growth rate calculation.
